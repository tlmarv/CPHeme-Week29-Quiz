        "choices": [
            "Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)",
            "Monoamine oxidase (MAO)",
            "Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH)",
            "Tyrosinase",
            "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine by dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) inside synaptic vesicles. Inhibiting this enzyme would directly reduce norepinephrine production. PNMT converts norepinephrine to epinephrine, MAO and COMT degrade catecholamines, and tyrosinase is unrelated to NE biosynthesis."

            "Inhibition of histamine release via H1 receptor blockade"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Epinephrine is the drug of choice for anaphylaxis because it has both alpha and beta adrenergic effects: - Alpha-1: Vasoconstriction, which reduces airway swelling and maintains blood pressure. - Beta-1: Increases heart rate and cardiac output to prevent cardiovascular collapse. - Beta-2: Bronchodilation, which relieves respiratory distress. These combined effects make epinephrine the most effective treatment for anaphylaxis."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone release. This leads to lower systemic vascular resistance and decreased sodium retention. They do not directly inhibit renin secretion or act as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The baroreceptor reflex maintains blood pressure by activating sympathetic outflow when blood pressure drops. In orthostatic hypotension, the failure to activate this response leads to inadequate vasoconstriction and a drop in blood pressure upon standing."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Baroreceptors detect decreased stretch and activate the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, thereby maintaining blood pressure. Parasympathetic activity would reduce cardiac output, and vasopressin is increased, not suppressed, in hypovolemia."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "In unilateral renal artery stenosis, the stenosed kidney experiences low perfusion pressure and responds by increasing renin secretion. The unaffected kidney, exposed to high systemic pressure, suppresses renin release, leading to an overall increase in circulating renin levels."

    "question": "A 60-year-old man presents with chest pain and dyspnea one year after experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI). He reports frequent nightmares and hypervigilance related to his cardiac health, constantly checking his pulse and fearing another MI. Which of the following best describes the underlying mechanism of his condition?",
    "choices": [
        "Increased parasympathetic activity leading to bradycardia",
        "Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis",
        "Decreased sympathetic tone leading to reduced cardiovascular risk",
        "Upregulation of nitric oxide synthesis leading to coronary vasodilation",
        "Suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient likely has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to his myocardial infarction. PTSD is associated with dysregulation of the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol, heightened sympathetic activity, endothelial dysfunction, and an increased risk of recurrent cardiac events."

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of cough, fever, and chills. She is confused and disoriented. Her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, pulse 125/min, and temperature 102.5°F. Exam shows right flank tenderness, and her urinalysis shows numerous white blood cells and bacteria. The blood white blood cell count is elevated. She is admitted to the intensive care unit. Her blood pressure does not change with 1 L of normal saline. Which of the following medications would be the most appropriate best next step in management?",
    "choices": [
        "Digoxin",
        "Dobutamine",
        "Milrinone",
        "Nitroprusside",
        "Norepinephrine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 4,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that stimulates adrenergic α and β receptors to cause vasoconstriction; it is the first-line treatment for septic shock, a form of distributive shock where systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is decreased. Digoxin, dobutamine, and milrinone are inotropes that increase cardiac contractility, but this patient has septic shock with low SVR and normal cardiac function, making these agents inappropriate. Nitroprusside is a vasodilator used in cardiogenic shock and would worsen blood pressure in distributive shock."

    "question": "A 45-year-old man with pheochromocytoma is scheduled for surgical resection of the tumor. To prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises, he is started on an irreversible alpha-adrenergic antagonist. Which of the following medications was most likely given?",
    "choices": [
        "Prazosin",
        "Phentolamine",
        "Phenoxybenzamine",
        "Clonidine",
        "Propranolol"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective, irreversible alpha-adrenergic antagonist used preoperatively for pheochromocytoma. It prevents catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction. Phentolamine is reversible, and prazosin is selective for α1. Beta-blockers (propranolol) should not be given before alpha-blockade, as they can cause unopposed α1-mediated vasoconstriction."

        "Propranolol",
        "Metoprolol",
        "Labetalol",
        "Timolol",
        "Carvedilol"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Metoprolol, a cardioselective β1 blocker, is preferred in patients with COPD or asthma because it has minimal β2 blockade, reducing the risk of bronchospasm. Non-selective beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, timolol, carvedilol, labetalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction."

    "choices": [
        "Upregulation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors",
        "Downregulation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors",
        "Rebound sympathetic outflow due to decreased CNS alpha-2 stimulation",
        "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)",
        "Excessive norepinephrine release due to increased vesicular storage"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Clonidine, a central α2-adrenergic agonist, suppresses sympathetic outflow from the CNS. Abrupt withdrawal causes rebound sympathetic activation, leading to severe hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation."
},
{
    "question": "A 55-year-old man with hypertension and heart failure is started on labetalol. Which of the following best describes how this drug lowers blood pressure?",
    "choices": [
        "Selective β1 blockade leading to decreased cardiac output",
        "Selective α1 blockade causing vasodilation",
        "Non-selective β blockade leading to bradycardia",
        "Combined α1 and β blockade leading to decreased blood pressure and heart rate",
        "Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake at synaptic terminals"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Labetalol is a combined α1 and β-adrenergic blocker. It lowers blood pressure by blocking α1 receptors (causing vasodilation) and β1 receptors (reducing heart rate and contractility), making it useful for hypertension and hypertensive emergencies."

{
    "question": "Which of the following events would most strongly trigger renin release in the kidney?",
    "choices": [
        "Becoming lightheaded after recurrent vomiting",
        "Developing severe hypertension (high blood pressure)",
        "Eating a salty meal",
        "Losing potassium in a bout of diarrhea",
        "Taking a drug with parasympathetic action"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is becoming lightheaded after recurrent vomiting. Renin release is stimulated by low blood pressure, high sympathetic activity, or low salt flow in the renal tubule. Vomiting leads to dehydration and volume depletion, activating these mechanisms. Hypertension (B) suppresses RAAS activation. Eating a salty meal (C) increases blood volume and suppresses RAAS. Potassium loss (D) affects aldosterone but does not directly regulate renin. Parasympathetic drugs (E) do not stimulate renin release, as renin-producing cells are primarily influenced by sympathetic input."
},
{
    "question": "A previously healthy patient comes in with stenosis of both renal arteries (vessel diameter is smaller). As a result, blood flow to the renal arterioles is severely decreased. What effect would this have on blood pressure?",
    "choices": [
        "Decrease",
        "Increase",
        "Increase, then decrease to normal",
        "No change"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is increase (B). Renal artery stenosis reduces renal perfusion, triggering renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). Increased renin leads to elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone, causing vasoconstriction and sodium retention, which ultimately raises blood pressure. Decreased renal blood flow would not lower BP (A), nor would it self-correct (C) or have no effect (D)."

{
    "question": "A previously healthy 71-year-old Black male is diagnosed with new-onset hypertension after two office visits with readings of 145/88 mm Hg. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?",
    "choices": [
        "Angiotensin-receptor blocker",
        "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor",
        "Calcium-channel blocker",
        "Lifestyle modification",
        "Thiazide diuretic"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is lifestyle modification (D). The initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension is lifestyle modifications, including DASH diet, exercise, weight loss, and alcohol cessation. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) would be excellent choices in patients with diabetes, kidney disease, or heart failure, but this patient has none of these conditions. If lifestyle modifications fail, the first-line pharmacologic treatments for hypertension in Black individuals are calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) or thiazide diuretics, as they are more effective than ACEIs/ARBs in this population due to lower renin activity."

    "question": "A 50-year-old obese female with tobacco use disorder and alcohol use disorder presents to the clinic for an annual checkup. Her blood pressure is 144/85 mm Hg. A week later, she comes to the clinic and her blood pressure is the same. Which of the following lifestyle interventions are least likely to have an effect on her blood pressure?",
    "choices": [
        "Alcohol cessation",
        "DASH diet",
        "Exercise",
        "Tobacco cessation",
        "Weight loss"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is tobacco cessation (D). Although quitting smoking has been shown to improve cardiovascular mortality, it does not significantly reduce blood pressure. Alcohol cessation (A) can reduce systolic blood pressure by 7.2 mm Hg in heavy drinkers. The DASH diet (B) lowers systolic BP by 5.5 mm Hg, and exercise (C) can reduce systolic BP by 3.8 mm Hg. Weight loss (E) is the most effective intervention, lowering systolic BP by up to 8.5 mm Hg. Therefore, tobacco cessation is the least effective intervention for blood pressure reduction."
